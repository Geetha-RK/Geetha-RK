## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated software developer with a Bachelorâ€™s in Information Technology and over 2 years of experience at UST, specifically working with the Anthem client. I also hold a Diploma in Software Engineering from BrainStation. During my time at BrainStation, I developed my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Sass. I applied these tools and methods in various projects, including my capstone project, WellnessPath, a hospital management application that utilized React for the front end and Node.js for the back end, ensuring seamless data handling and user experience.

ðŸ’¡ Always Learning

My passion for technology ignited early, driven by the creativity and problem-solving involved in building applications. I thrive on transforming ideas into reality and enjoy the challenges of crafting intuitive user experiences and developing robust solutions that make a real impact. My commitment to continuous learning and adaptability in the fast-paced tech landscape allows me to blend modern web practices with my experience in backend development at UST. Iâ€™m passionate about exploring new technologies and refining my skills to deliver clean, efficient code.

I hold certifications as a Salesforce Platform Developer and Salesforce Administrator, providing me with a solid foundation in Salesforce technologies.

I am actively seeking opportunities in full-stack development. If youâ€™re looking for a passionate developer to join your team, please feel free to reach out!
